                Let’s make something clear: we would love for unpaid internships
                to become entirely a thing of the past. We’re not trying to
                enable unpaid placements, but everyone knows that changing
                policy and work culture will take time. We are working with
                other organisations to campaign for living wage internships.
                Until this changes we want PressPad to exist for anyone and
                everyone that needs it.

                  Staying with Emily was an absolute pleasure. I learned a great
                  deal about how to approach politicians and very much enjoyed
                  the city. We managed to go to a few journalistic events as
                  well and met some amazing people!
